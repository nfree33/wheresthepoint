        <p>'Where's the Point?' is based off a 2019 viral game that took the nation by storm. It's fun, easy, and can be played anywhere!
        <p>The rules are simple. Players take alternating turns on offense and defense:
            <ul> 
                <li>Offense: you point either up, down, left, or right.</li>
                <li>Defense: With no hesitation, you must look in a different direction from the offensive players 'point'.</li>
                <li>In this digital version, you have three lives. The game is over once you or the CPU looses all their lives.</li>
            </ul>
        </p></p>
